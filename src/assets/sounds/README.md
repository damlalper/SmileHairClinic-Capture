# Audio Assets

## Required Audio Files

Place the following audio files in this directory:

### beep.mp3
- **Purpose**: Radar-style feedback sound
- **Requirements**:
  - Short duration (0.1-0.3 seconds)
  - Variable pitch capability
  - Format: MP3 or WAV
  - Sample rate: 44.1 kHz recommended

## Temporary Workaround

The app will function without audio files but will show console warnings. The audio feedback feature will be disabled until files are added.

## Creating Audio Files
